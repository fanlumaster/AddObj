# About

Just a simple try for studying COM(Component Object Model).

The original artile is [here](https://www.codeguru.com/soap/step-by-step-com-tutorial/).

And we could find the original codebase [here](https://github.com/grimripper/grim_com_testing) or another changed version [here](https://github.com/HIT-Alibaba/COM-Example).

I made some adjustments so that we could use cmake to compile this project.

Take it easy to study COM and have fun!
